# 6_degress_of_separation

1)The last project of Advanced Data Structures class.
The purpose of this project is to find the shortest sequence of common shared movies between two actors/actresses.

2)Designed the representation of the undirected graph with the most appropriate data structures to get the best possible running time.
Implemented BFS and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to find the shared movie connection, as well as Disjoint Set to find the earliest year when those two actors/actresses are connected.
